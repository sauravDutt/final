            <h2 style='font-weight:300'>What is a Blockchain?</h2>
            <p>
              Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Objective is to create a <mark style='background-color: #96d6c6'> cryptocurrency, called the StashCoin </mark>, every thing about it is going to be open sourced, at <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-github"></i>/stashCoin</a>, be sure to keep checking it out !!
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's read through some of the additional but important things I have been researching on the go.
          </p>
          <h4 style='font-weight: 300'>What is a node in Blockchain?</h4>
          <p>
            <mark>A blockchain node is an open-source, cross-platform runtime that allows developers to create various services.</mark> The P2P protocol allows nodes to communicate with each other within the network and transfer information about transactions and new blocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Network nodes are responsible for the correctness and reliability of storing the entered data in the distributed ledger. Each node can store a complete copy of the distributed ledger. Thanks to the blockchain nodes, any user can access the data and can view all transactions conducted or stored on the network.
          </p>
          <p>
            Launching a network node used to be practically the only way to connect to the blockchain. Each new node contributes to the decentralization of the blockchain network, shortening the transaction time, and reducing fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            By setting up your node, you receive a small income from the transactions that go through your channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nodes participate in consensus, share information about transactions and the number of funds, confirm transactions and store copies of confirmations, participate in the building of new blocks in the chain, for which they receive a reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            A business using nodes is built on receiving commissions for transfers, purchase/sale of cryptocurrency assets on the exchange.
          </p>
          <h4 style='font-weight: 300'>Next Question is how to deploy a node?</h4>
          <p>
            To deploy a full node, a number of requirements must be taken into account. If earlier it was possible to launch a node on weak equipment, now, when blockchains have grown into popular networks, memory and processor power are a decisive factor in the successful deployment of a node.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before starting to deploy a node, you need to clarify the minimum hardware requirements. They may differ for each of the currently existing cryptocoins. For example,  the minimum requirements for installing a Bitcoin node are:
            <ul>
              <li>Your device must have the latest version of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.</li>
              <li>500 GB or more of free disk space available with a minimum read speed of 100 MB/s.</li>
              <li>SSD capable of performing: 68 MB / s random write and 30.9 MB / s random read. At least 112GB capacity. At least 8 GB of random access memory (RAM)</li>
              <li>Broadband Internet connection with a download speed of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second. The connection must be unlimited with high upload limits.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Running your own Ethereum node requires system administrator skills. Synchronization of an Ethereum node is possible in three modes: fast, full, and light. By default, fast is used. In this mode, there is no download of transaction history, wallet balances, smart contract codes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most expensive is full mode as it requires powerful hardware: 16 Gb of RAM and a capacious SSD disk. Synchronization of the Ethereum archive node with tracing can take several weeks, and even then, on an SSD disk. In case of an error in the client/software version for a node, it is necessary to re-synchronize the node from scratch. This can be an expensive process. You should also take care of the security of your site, which will require cybersecurity skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you start synchronization from the HDD (hard disk), the node may not "sync" due to the difference between the speed of blockchain creation (as a rule, it is higher) and the speed of writing to disk. Both the speed of the network connection and the power of the equipment are important.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ethereum light node synchronization mode has the most complaints. Errors often occur, although this mode is one of the most balanced: fast synchronization, less resource use, wallet balances, and smart contracts are pulled up.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of writing, the Bitcoin network is supported by over 11 thousand nodes. Most of them are deployed in North America and Western Europe. There are 6447 active Ethereum nodes, according to the statistics of 10 countries with the highest number of nodes.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can connect a node either to the main network or run it on a test network for any of your purposes: testing, development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard Ethereum node runs right in the console by default. It runs as a background process by writing service in the system or starting a node on the screen. You should carefully monitor in which mode the node is started. If the node is run in test mode, then you will not be able to track transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To install a Bitcoin node, you need to create a folder to store blockchain data somewhere in your filesystem. To sync the full bitcoin blockchain, 380 GB is required today.
          </p>
          <p>The process can take a long time. Hardware problems can also be detected, and an interrupted download will resume from the moment it was interrupted. After a successful copy, the client starts the blockchain synchronization process. Further, to start the node, you need to allow an incoming connection through port 8333 in your firewall.</p>
          <p>
            The next step is to check if the node is working. To do this, send a request to the node with any information about the service, or request data from the blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will also want to monitor the node, for which you can use a standard service availability check on the TCP port. If the node crashes, you will have to restart it manually.
          </p>
          <p><strong>
            Problems might face when deploying a node yourself : 
          </strong></p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Limited bandwidth: Some internet plans will charge extra for using excess bandwidth not included in the plan. Make sure you don't have traffic restrictions before deploying your node. Additionally, the internet connection may be unstable. If the synchronization of the node with the blockchain network will be interrupted, then a restart is required.</li>
              <li>If site deployment occurs on your business network, it can slow down or bottleneck in normal network traffic.</li>
              <li>Parts of known computer viruses have been placed by a group of people on the bitcoin blockchain. It is not possible to infect your computer with such data, but some antivirus programs move them to quarantine, which makes it difficult for the bitcoin core to work. Most often this fact takes place on computers running Windows.</li>
              <li>A third party (hackers) might find that a new full node is up and running and try to hack it. You are entirely responsible to ensure your node is not hacked.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            As a summary, launching a full node on your own requires you: financial costs for purchasing equipment complying with that node requirements, ensuring uninterrupted Internet connection, and the ability to use the command line.
